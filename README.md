# AutoGnome Project

A minimal approach to building self-referential systems, inspired by:

1. Braitenberg's Vehicles - Simple units with emergent complex behavior
2. Hofstadter's Strange Loops - Self-reference as basis for consciousness
3. Metzinger's Being No One - Self-model theory of consciousness

## AutoGnomes (AG)

 - [x] AG 1: Pulses "I exist" at regular intervals. Minimal self-assertion.
 - [x] AG 2: Has a name and one state variable: energy level. After a pulse, energy level is reduced. When energy level reaches 0, the autognome stops.
 - [ ] AG 3: Sensor for monitoring its own energy level and ability to decide to rest or continue. Spending one pulse without saying anything is a rest.
